They did an excellent job of staying true to the story. As you watch this movie you are reminded of the faith AND patience of Joseph. If anyone in history had a reason to throw his hands up and declare that God had forgotten him it was Joseph, yet he remained faithful. The full story is told, even the account of Judah and Tamar which ended up in the birth of the root of the kingly line of Israel. Virtually everything was portrayed and accurately so. To me, the main point they really nailed was how Joseph woke up one day, still a prisoner, and by sunset he was the second most powerful man on the face of the Earth. This led to another fantastic lesson, Joseph all of a sudden had all the power anyone could want and while today we see people desire power so they can lord it over those beneath them and settle old scores, Joseph instead showed compassion. He could have easily destroyed his brothers or a least made them suffer as he had suffered but instead he displayed true character.... a lesson many in positions of power today could learn from. The story of Joseph is one of the most remarkable in Biblical history and rightly so.\nYou can spend your hard earned dollars with confidence when you buy this movie and you will want to either loan it to others or buy it for them as a gift.

Filmed in Morocco, this treatment of the rags to riches biblical story explores the political intrigue of Joseph's polygamous family and subsequently the Egyptian court. Joseph has long been regarded as a forerunner of Jesus, and the movie alludes to this similarity several times. In fact, Joseph's story is an Old Testament illustration of Jesus' observation that \"no prophet is accepted in his own country,\" (Luke 4:24). Joseph's talent for interpreting dreams provokes his brothers to sell him into slavery, but the same talent proves enormously profitable for him in Egypt.\n\nPerhaps the most relevant connection between the 1995 movie and the present time is the debate over prosperity theology, which proposes that one can enjoy God's blessings --particularly health and wealth-- on earth. Joseph, as portrayed by the athletic Paul Mercurio, is certainly capable of fighting back against his oppressors, but instead of physical aggression, he chooses to assert himself through faith, talent, honesty, and impressive political courage --attributes which eventually earn him riches in Egypt.\n\nFollowers of prosperity theology are seen by some Christians as heretics who love money, but the Joseph movie is an epic struggle for the good life, and it raises larger questions. Don't most Christians work for a better life? Don't they repeat refrains, such as \"God helps those who help themselves\" and \"When opportunity knocks, answer the door\"? Is the ascetic life advocated by the Bible practical or even responsible in the postmodern world? Was Joseph as a long suffering slave morally superior to Joseph as a rich governor who saved Egypt and its neighbors from death by famine? Several biblical characters have inspired many an inspirational film, but the Joseph movie strikes at the heart of money's problematic role in Christian life.", "summary": "Is Joseph the Future of Christianity?", "unixReviewTime": 1428710400}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "04 10, 2015", "reviewerID": "A1NATV4A7AGXBX", "asin": "0005119367", "style": {"Format:": " DVD"}, "reviewerName": "readaholic", "reviewText": "This is my favorite Paul Mercurio movie.  As Joseph he is a truly unharnessed character whose angst is so deep, visually apparent and so complete that we are free to empathize with him. The multi dimensional emotional conflict from within the character is so palpable that it\ndevelops its own spiritual presence in the hot tub seduction scene.  And, the gentle, sweet, forgiving demeanor of Joseph when he reveals\nhimself to his brothers at the end just ties the story together and brings it to a close with an all encompassing forceful power that is just so\nrefreshing.  No violence, no revenge, just powerful forgiveness mixed with a dash of gratitude for the end resulting exalted / elevated status\nthat resulted from his brothers' betrayal.  I love using this movie to learn languages.  The layered emotion and richness makes it, for me, a movie classic.  I think Paul Mercurio movies in general are great language learning tools.  They are so interesting that I don't mind watching them many times.  And, watching anything more than once is a rare occurrence for me.

There are times when Hollywood takes EXTREME licenses with biblical stories, transforming them into something unrecognizable (i.e. Noah).  However, that is not the case with Joseph.  The movie stays very close to the biblical account with some minor addition added to enhance the story and to drive home a point.  It effectively demonstrated how God can take a circumstance that to us can seem evil and use to bring about good.  As for those people who were offended by the \"bath scene\", I say read story from Genesis again.  Potiphar's  wife pressured Joseph DAY AFTER DAY for sex. In order for the movie to drive this home effectively without being pornographic, it showed her attempting to seduce him while he was bathing.  Now the although this can be inappropriate for younger viewers, the reality is that it does not deviate drastically from the biblical account and it does not warrant the movie a bad review.  I'll tell anyone with very small children not to watch this with them until they are of an age where you are ready to talk to them about sexual issues.

Written for television by: Lionel Chetwynd, this 1995 film which also features... not one, but two Academy Award winning Actors: Sir Ben Kingsley as 'Potiphar' and Martin Landau as 'Jacob', also won the prestigious Emmy Award for: \"Outstanding Miniseries.\" And, although it focuses on the life of JOSEPH, it also chronicles the latter life of his father Jacob, together with his wives, his concubines, his only sister - Dinah, and the lives of his brothers, as well. From the popular \"Bible Collection\" Films of which (at this date), there are 13 available, Turner Pictures presents a Lube Production in association with Lux Beta Films and Rai Uno in presenting this disturbing yet deeply moving and climactic film: JOSEPH, in it's entirety. All, 187-minutes of it. This compelling, motion picture/miniseries, vividly depicts the willful, calculated and brutal betrayal of 17-year old JOSEPH, the 11th son of 12 brothers. Who, was maliciously sold into slavery, to appease their jealousy of him. What are older brothers for, eh?! So why..., were they so cruel and viciously envious of JOSEPH? Because he was their father's obvious favorite (Genesis 37:3-4). Sibling rivalry? Oh yeah! And, then some!! In viewing this captivating drama, one cannot help but wonder..., how it helped JOSEPH's brother's to be so jealous of him? And what did they hope to accomplish with their continued envy, scorn and contempt towards their innocent, younger brother? It certainly wasn't going to change their father's love for him. Neither, would it change the fact, that JOSEPH was the long awaited, first-born son of Jacob's favorite wife, Rachel. Nor would it diminish their feelings of paternal rejection, deep seated inadequacies and personal insecurities from which, acute jealousy, stems. But, aside from his younger brother Benjamin, his only sibling by the same mother (Rachel), the 10 older brothers and their level of jealousy towards him escalated too such a fever pitch, that initially they literally plotted to murder JOSEPH. But, due to the sanity and shrewdness of the one brother, they opted to throw him into a cold, dry, well, complete with snakes. The following morning, they literally sold him..., to Ishmaelite Slave Traders for 20 pieces of silver. Talk about betrayal, treachery, deviousness, jealousy and abject hatred! Again, was there any brotherly love, here? No way! And, they all made a profit from literally..., selling out his person. So how, did their acute jealousy help anything? It didn't. From the on-set, jealousy of another breeds resentment and hostility. Unbridled, it only suffices to kill and destroy. In this particular case, blatant deceit combined with needless treachery together with their murderous envy, sheer hatred and concealment of their vile crime, manifested itself in a heinous betrayal against their own brother. And, as if that weren't enough, they further added insult to injury by deliberately lying too their father, Jacob. How? By corporately telling him the tale, that JOSEPH was dead and gone. Because he supposedly, was killed by a wild animal. And, they 'offered' his blood stained coat which Jacob had made for him, as \"proof.\" Meanwhile, JOSEPH... who was very much alive, was re-sold in Egypt by the Ishmaelite Slave Traders, to Potiphar - the Captain of the Pharaoh's Guard. So, as far as the envious brother's were concerned, JOSEPH was seemingly out of the picture and doomed to the wretched existence of a slave. And for years, such was the case. And Jacob, having lost his favorite son, along with his pride and joy upon whom all of his hopes of leading the family clan were founded, continued to grieve for his thought to be dead, son. Because when you truly love someone, their absence only makes the heart grow fonder. The years wore on..., and JOSEPH grew to become very handsome. He was a man of excellence and integrity, who knew how to read and write (most slaves didn't), and one who carried himself in a humble manner. As was pleasing to his master, Potiphar. However, for as much as Potiphar trusted JOSEPH... to the point that he elevated him to be his personal assistant and household accountant, so too, did Potiphar's' promiscuous wife (as portrayed by Actress: Lesley Ann Warren) decide, that she would take advantage of the situation and use JOSEPH's strong, attractive, physique for her own sexual pleasure. But, there was only one problem. JOSEPH refused to sleep with her. And she, incensed at having her advances rejected by a mere slave, spitefully and vindictively accused him of a most heinous crime. Rape. (Yup! All of this..., sex and all, is really within the Holy Bible. And, at the beginning of this review, you were provided with: Chapter, scripture and verse(s), so you can read it for yourself). So, what happened to JOSEPH? Well, having heard that his wife was supposedly raped, Potiphar stripped JOSEPH of his position and status, and further placed him into Pharaoh's prison. Where common thieves, cut throat's and all sorts of criminals are kept. Hardly the place, for an innocent and educated man, like JOSEPH. A man of breeding and integrity. However, just as Potiphar was impressed with the way JOSEPH carried himself and handled his assigned duties, so too, was the prison warden into whose prison care, JOSEPH was placed. To the point, that he elevated JOSEPH to the position of prison overseer, who was in charge of all the other prisoners. Years went by, and then came the fateful day when two of Pharaoh's employee's - a wine bearer and a baker, were placed into prison under JOSEPH's care. Utilizing his gift that the Lord had given to him (that of interpreting dreams), JOSEPH correctly foretold the dreams of both, the baker and the wine bearer. Specifically, that the wine bearer would be reinstated into Pharaoh's employ and that the baker would die in prison. It came to pass just as JOSEPH had stated, and having been restored, the wine bearer remembered and told Pharaoh about JOSEPH, when Pharaoh's' court see's could not interpret Pharaoh's dreams. JOSEPH was summoned to Pharaoh's Court and after hearing and accurately predicting the dreams of the Pharaoh, he was rewarded and promoted to the position of Governor of all, Egypt. Second only, to Pharaoh himself. Believe it! And what, became of JOSEPH's brother's? Well, suffice it to say, that the rest of this powerful drama is a story of forgiveness, healing, reconciliation and restoration. And yes, JOSEPH's brother's got a lesson that they wouldn't soon forget! This is a deeply moving, epic, biblical drama that comes to it's audience in color, on a single-disc, DVD in spoken English in 4.0 Dolby Digital Surround Sound and also, in 2.0 Dolby Digital Spanish. With subtitles in English, Spanish and French. And shows in full screen format for approximately 187-minutes. To say the least, it is a very interesting motion picture that does much more, than just entertain.

A God can be anything that you put first and foremost before the only One and True Living God who created this earth and everything in it.

Also, Joseph's servant cuts the brothers' grain sacks open, spilling the grain on the ground.  Rather, Genesis leads me to believe that he simply opened the sacks and looked inside.  Also, Genesis says that the brothers took chariots laden with provisions to tell Jacob of Joseph's position in Egypt.  The movie has them walking all the way, with no chariots.\n\nThe scene where Potiphar's wife tries to seduce Joseph is a little to racy.  He's clearly naked in a bath, and she touches him.

(For example, in this version, Potiphar believes Joseph is innocent of immorality with his wife, and Joseph tells him about his past as a flashback, not found in the Bible.)  The massacre at Shechem in Genesis 34 is included and shows what rotten people some of Joseph's brothers were.  The actors for the brothers do very well demonstrating individuality but also a group mentality, and they show powerful character change by the end.  It's interesting that the movie shows the brothers have really changed just by showing their eager attitude in blessing the name of God with their father Jacob (\"Blessed be His name\")!  The actor for Jacob does very well, too.  (The actor for Joseph is fine, too, but the character couldn't have too much personality, because every viewer has a preconceived expectation of what he should be like.)  The movie introduced me to an interesting idea, which is that Jacob may have been involved in preserving genealogies and stories from Abraham.  The Book of Genesis does have a much more continuous account of Jacob's life, whereas stories of Abraham's life are like disconnected snapshots.

As a Bible-believing Christian and follower of Christ, the main criteria for me is always the question--Is it true to the biblical text? This movie, combined with the King James language is extremely close to the biblical text and I can almost follow along in scripture with many scenes. It is very enjoyable and portrays the biblical account in a fresh, relevant way.\n\nI highly recommend Joseph to any family and encourage any parent to watch it with their children, teenagers and even young adults that may be out of the home and on their own. Recently, I watched David from this Collection with my 23-year-old son when he came to visit and am awaiting his return to watch Joseph.\n\nThe movie is poignant and lively as it retells the story of the brothers' betrayl and sin against Joseph as they sell him into slavery. During these scenes, my heart was gripped, feeling many emotions as the story unfolded.\n\nI believe this movie does an excellent job portraying the story of faith as Joseph rises to prominence within Pharoah's court, suffers in prison because of false accusations, and especially as he forgives his brothers. Joseph's revelation of his identity to his brothers and his reunion with his family is outstanding and emotionally moving.\n\nThe acting of Ben Kingsley as Pharoah and the rest of the cast is superb and it is best to watch it when you have 3 hours to set aside or take an intermission in the middle of it. This movie will enhance your biblical knowledge of Joseph while adding a visual dimension to your Bible knowledge.\n\nThe movie also provides a wonderful introduction with moral lessons to any child, teenager or young adult. Another movie that I highly recommended from The Bible Collection is David starring Nathaniel Parker and Leonard Nimoy.

Or as one of your reviewers commented, there are messianic threads cleverly interwoven throughout. For example, nowhere in the old testament does Jacob EVER say that he gives his inheritance to Joseph. This is an obvious suggestion that Jesus, descended from the tribe of Joseph (and whose nominal \"father\" is Joseph)is to inherit Gods blessings, with Christians inheriting the covenant of the Israelites. And the scene of Joseph imprisoned in the Pharaoh's prison saying to God \"why have you forsaken me\" is NOWHERE mentioned in the old testament; it is strictly put in to provide a Christian slant. Toward the end of the movie, when Joseph goes to see his father, there is a scene in which a large number of crosses appear (briefly). And incidentally, when Joseph and his father meet, the former is shown bowing down to the latter. However, as is clearly stated in the old testament, when Joseph has his dream in which the sun, moon and the stars bow before him, for this dream to be fulfilled (as are all the others in the Joseph story), Jacob (the sun) must bow down to Joseph, not the reverse. I don't have a problem with Christian Messianic films, and I in fact saw this on the Trinity Broadcasting Network, but before everyone falls all over themselves saying what a saintly film this is, please, recognise that it has been made with a specific point of view in mind, namely Christianity, and that there are other perspectives on the Joseph story that are quite different.

I will simply say that this timeless true account of a faithful and courageous young man is a wonderful tool to use with teenagers.  Satan has planted so much filth in the movie industry, and I praise God that there are filmmakers who still desire to present the truth.  \"Joseph\" presents a magnificent story of forgiveness and integrity that all teenagers can learn from.\n\nThis miniseries is one of the best biblical retellings in film fashion I've ever come across.  The story grabs you from the very beginning and is never dull.  Paul Mercurio is excellent in his portrayal of Joseph, presenting a teenager and young man with exceptional character.  Mercurio brings a vulnerability to this man that endeared him to me at once.  The scene where he cries for mercy after his brothers' betrayal moved me to tears.  Joseph struggles with temptations and is flawed like us all.  Ben Kingsley is excellent as Potipher, portraying a man of integrity and care.  The actors portraying Joseph's brothers are equally excellent.\n\nSeveral reviewers have complained about the scene with Joseph and Potipher's wife, a femme fatale portrayed with unabashed glee by Leslie Ann Warren.  This scene is sexually charged, but I believe it is accurate with Scripture.  The Bible doesn't sugarcoat things, nor should we think the Bible hereos were not susceptible to temptation.  Although God never reveals if Potipher's wife was a temptation to Joseph, I logically don't see how she could not have ben.  He was, after all, seventeen when the attempted seduction took place.  Wouldn't any of us struggle in this area at this age? Besides, seeing Joseph struggle makes the viewer empathize with his predicament.

The only real problem (meaning unacceptable) is the bath-tub scene with Joseph.  He's seen from waist up, in a pool relazing/bathing, and in comes his boss's wife who's been after him sexually.  Potiphar's wife seductively rubs up and down his chest, until (WITH MUSIC AND SOUND EFFECTS GOING ALONG WITH THE SEDUCTIVITY) she goes down into the water below his waist and connects with his genitals (yes, for real).  Both Joseph and her are shown to react to the moment ever so....\"slightly\" and then she leaves him alone until the next time she confronts him.  We had this film for YEARS and thought how awesomely Biblical (compared to any other film) this movie was, but never noticed this part until this year.  Why?  because we had younger children at the time, and so the inferred sexual tension of her rubbing his shoulders over the bath-tub/pool was something we'd simply pass by w/ the fast-fwd button a mere several seconds.  We didn't do that this year, and WHOOOAH!!  We were SHOCKED at what transpired in those few moments.  They don't show below the water, but they PLAY UP the moment big time to let you know what is happening.  For this reason, i say DON'T BUY THE MOVIE unless you can edit it.  If i had this film on VCR, i'd simply tab the \"edit\" tab on the VCR tape and i'd record a whole minute or two over that one moment (which wouldn't hurt a 3-plus hour long film!).\n\nIt's truly a shame that the film makers snuck in a scene of this degree, they simply could have ended with the woman rubbing Joseph's shoulders in flirtation (showing her constant pursuit of him) and played up the moment that way, at that time.  However, they stuck a little leaven in to satisfy Hollywood and to \"leaven the whole loaf\" with making it clear that she was touching his genitals for a bit and he was helpless to deal with the tempation for a few moments.  This cheap move by the film makers reminds me of the \"Sampson\" film put out by the Bible Collection film makers....which is TOTALLY TRASHY...taking the sexuality way OVERBOARD for the Sampson screen (don't buy it!

The casting was great (Okay fine, Josephs former master was a white woman, so what? She played her part well I thought). Sexually explicit scenes? Give me a break. There were no sexually explicit scenes. There was a scene of Joseph in the bath being tempted by Potiphar's wife. This is no different from a man/woman dealing with sexual thoughts/temptations daily, and that powerful scene would give any Christian in the spirit a visual illustration of the pressure Joseph felt. I especially liked his line when he said to her \"please, you push the limits of my body to more than it can bear.\" The other added scenes did not take anything away from the movie, but gave it dimension. I will take 1 star away only because I do not think that scene where the brother slept with the \"prostitute\" who turned out to be his other brothers wife or whatever was necessary. Besides one or two minor things, overall I thought it was a great film, and the reunion at the end was well acted.\n\nTo the critics harping on sexually explicit, blah blah, gimme a break. There were no sexually explicit scenes in the film. Everything was very \"PG-13\" if not lower. If you call that sexually explicit then you should be censoring Songs of Solomon in the Bible which gives some steamy accounts from Solomon to his \"lover,\" or better yet, you should censor Jesus Christs crucifixion, which was very R-rated (being beaten, flogged, and nailed to a cross seems R-rated to me).

(like.. what happened re Potiphar's wife after Joseph became the Governor of all Egypt.. and how did Joseph's brother's explain to Jacob that he wasn't dead after all but that they were lyings cowards who now had to come clean?) I loved that they included the story of how Tamar got pregnant by Joshua even if they misrepresented the tale of how the first 2 sons had died because of their wickedness before the Lord.\nThis movie is not perfect.. not totally accurate scripturally.. ie \" the rains never came but the Nile flooded\" when it only required the Nile to flood.. and the miniscule effort shown re the silos to hold 7 years grain etc etc.. but the story telling was marvellous and the starting from the middle of the tale to tell the story and adding the beginning as an insert.. all marvellous telling of an amazing tale.. the tale of the brothers, and the growth of Joseph and his relation to Jacob was excellent and well played. I have seen Martin Landau in many a movie or programme but he moves me to tears by his portrayal of Jacob and his love for Joseph. I love finding nitpicks in movies and this one has many too.. (ie the Tamar who receives the seal & staff is a different woman  than the beauty who plays her in most of the part) but overall it is an amazing truthful retelling of a biblical classic and if fairly accurate.. even the 'explicit' parts only show the realiry of the situation and any man can be moved to realise how easy it would have been to give in to temptation.. yet Joseph overcame.. Lesley Ann Warren was fabulous as the seductress looking amazing and then quickly becoming the horrid scorned woman.. tremendous.. Ben Kingsley as Potiphar opened my eyes to certain realities of scripture that I hadn't realised before.. and Paul Mercurio as Joseph with his real Joseph and emotive performance.. I found (and still find) the watching a wonderfully emotive and enlightening experience everytime I watch it.. and I watch it regularly.. it is the best of the bunch.. and a classic in it's own right.

I have not done extensive study on history and ancient civilizations, but I can read the Bible.  At first I was quite pleased with their faithfulness to the Biblical account, but then I believe the filmmakers departed from the written account on some of the most crucial details of the story.\n\nAt certain key points, Joseph was portrayed as incapable of standing on his own, apparently needing women to help him understand what was going on, to help him forgive his brothers, etc.  That's not the Joseph I read about.  Then Pharaoh needed women to convince him that Joseph knew what he was talking about.  That is not at all the case.  (And I am not against women.)  Pharaoh was the one who immediately recognized what was in Joseph.  Genesis 41:38  \"Can we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the Spirit of God?\"  He recognized that on the first encounter.  There was no second conversation with Joseph about the dreams.  Pharaoh did not dismiss him on the first encounter.\n\nWhat was the point of rushing down to get Joseph when he was brought back to Pharaoh, stripping his clothes off, and having two young ladies wash him from behind?  I don't read that anyone tried to scare Joseph when they told him Pharaoh wanted to see him.  Genesis 41:14 says that \"they brought him hastily out of the dungeon; and he shaved, changed his clothing, and came to Pharaoh.\"\n\nAnother reviewer writes, \"Although some of the sexually explicit (though historically accurate) scenes should be screened from the very young...\"  What about single or married, young or old guys, watching practically R rated scenes?  I don't think people other than children are immune from being provoked.  Does an interest in history and Bible stories have to subject us to sexually explicit material?\n\nAnd what is the point of showing Joseph's wife in the bath?  I bet they had to shoot that scene repeatedly to keep from showing her breasts in the angles from the front, and it required split second timing in editing to keep from showing her behind as she was getting out of the pool.  Is that required to tell the story of Joseph?\n\nSome of the rest of the material might make sense if it were called the story of Genesis.  But what does the story of Joseph have to do with Judah's escapade with Tamar?  Is that really an integral part of the story of Joseph?  I think the director was glad to have a little more material, having the opportunity to show a situation with someone preparing to make out with a harlot, showing all the way up to the point where she begins to lift her dress and bare her leg, leaving the rest to your imagination.\n\nI will not dispute that two of Joseph's brothers wiped out all the males in a city as revenge for their sister being raped (Genesis 34).  Of course many details are up to the film maker, but it struck me as being unnecessary to show those same men saying, \"Praise be to God\" (or some such similar phrase) in one breath, and then plotting to kill all the males in the next breath.  Again, I'm not sure how critical that whole incident is to the story of Joseph.  Maybe it is--I won't argue too much on that point.\n\nAnd the Jacob (Joseph's father) we see in the film is not the Jacob I imagine.  He looked pretty weak, lacking in self-confidence, and lacking in confidence in God.  I don't think Jacob was quite so timid.  That's my personal reading of the scriptures.\n\nThe story of Joseph is one of my favorite stories in the Bible, but I would like to forget most of what I saw.  For me, the scene where Joseph was reunited with his brothers was weak.  What about Joseph weeping aloud, and \"the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard it.\"  (Genesis 45:2)  Couldn't the actor muster up that kind of emotion?\n\nSeeing the film did help me to imagine a little better what it was like when certain things happened.  Joseph crying out from the pit was particularly poignant.  But I would not recommend this film to anyone.  To me, it's not an accurate representation of what happened, and it does not portray Joseph as the strong man of God that he was.\n\nIf you are watching this film to get a better understanding of the Bible, I think you should be careful. I don't think this movie was written by a Christian or directed by a Christian.  I think it could possibly just be a ploy to dupe gullible Christians into watching a sexually explicit movie (with historically accurate stuff mixed in), and slightly distorting their understanding of what actually happened.

This is one of a series of made for TV movies about important figures in the Old Testament.  I've previously reviewed several other stories in this series, but this is the best of a strong series in my view.  The acting is top notch, and I found the final confrontation between Joseph and his brothers to be particularly moving and well done.  Like many of the films in this series, it is a story about faith and perserverance.  The writer and producer did a particularly good job of fleshing out the story of Joseph from Genesis without adding lots of non-Biblical threads.  One thing that I like about this movie (and about the series as a whole) is that they are not overdone.  These aren't special effects-laden films with casts of thousands, but rely on writing and good acting to convey the tale.

It's as much a tear-jerker as the old Ross Hunter/Lana Turner films! And, the performances, especially that of Paul Mercurio in the title role, (WHY don't we see more work from him?), Martin Landau as his father Jacob, Ben Kingsly as the Egyptian over-seer Pontiphur, and Lesly Ann Warren as his wife, are exceptional! There is even a most erotically charged scene or two between Pontiphur's adulteress wife and a scantily clad Joseph. Most everyone already knows the story. Joseph is the favored son of his father, inspiring lethal jealousy from his other sons, Joseph's brothers. They conspire to get rid of Joseph, but can't bring themselves to actually kill him, so they sell him into slavery. He ends up in Egpyt and, over the years, thanks to his talent for explaining the meanings of dreams, rises to a position of power second only to Pharaoh. Circumstances reunite Joseph with his brothers, although they don't know who he is. The revelation of his identity to them and his reunion with his father will touch the heart of anyone who has one!

Secondly, he overcame all of the serious setbacks in his  troubled life, as opposed to most of us, who are overcome by our  disasters.\nThe production is basically very faithful to the Biblical  account, and even tries to explain the more puzzling aspects of the story,  such as Potiphar's ambivalent judgement after the \"rape\", or why  Joseph never sought out his father after he achieved greatness. It also  tries to show the Egyptian/Hebrew language barrier at times. The  final  parts are somewhat paraphrased, to save running time, but are still  faithful to the essence of the story.\nThe performances of Ben Kingsley  (Potiphar) and Martin Landau (Jacob) are superb, and Paul Mercurio  (Joseph), despite his necessary youth and therefore less experience, does a  good job,  although his \"body language\" often outdoes his spoken  one.\nThere are however a few negatives, such as the below-par sets and  costumes, indicating perhaps a somewhat spartan budget. Also, Joseph's  meteoric rise to governor not only features a poorly type- cast actor for  Pharoh, but would have been far  more plausible if his achievements in  organizing  Potiphar's house and Pharoh's prison were cited. Also, the  distinction between slave and servant / commoner is blurred throughout; and  the chronology of the story, with all those periods of \"7 years\",  is not always the most probable one.\nBut overall this is an excellent,  well recommended telling of the story of Joseph the Patriach.", "summary": "Joseph (1995)", "unixReviewTime": 960336000}, {"overall": 4.0, "vote": "7", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "05 1, 2000", "reviewerID": "A1F12ZFB3LP2JB", "asin": "0005119367", "style": {"Format:": " VHS Tape"}, "reviewerName": "Amazon Customer", "reviewText": "I thought that this film was really good, i just wish they had made it sutible for children by cutting out a few things and putting some clothes on the egyptian women.

You need 6 1/2 hours to watch it. But it is well worth the time.\n\nMr. Gibson's \"The Passion\" (2004) was interesting if you want to see just to what extent Jesus suffered.  I also give Mel Gibson credit for underlining that the mass is not only a reenactment of the Last Supper, but it also embodies the sorrowful events of Good Friday and the glorious events of Easter Sunday.  (Though it's far from what I would call a child friendly version.)\n\nThis is a great version if you don't have 6 1/2 hours to watch the phenomenal \"Jesus of Nazareth,\" or if you don't feel up to the brutal and intense \"The Passion.\"\n\nThis film is kept at a 2 hour length.  But the tradeoff is that the events in the film are ONLY from the \"Gospel According to Luke.\"  That probably won't bother everyone, but I felt obligated to point out that you can't expect the best scenes of all 4 Gospels.\n\nAlright. Onto the subject at hand. The film begins with Mary being visited by the Holy Spirit. Another thing I should point out is that to help keep the film under 2 hours, narration is used to explain the shift from event to event.\n\nI'd rather not go too much into a plot synopsis. If you have read \"Luke,\" you probably already have an idea of what is to follow. I can however say that the film is done with a beautiful style that has dignity and is not overdone. Brian Deacon (Jesus) doesn't play the role with the same intensity that Robert Powell did in \"Jesus of Nazareth.\" But Deacon gives the role a gentle dignity. He gives a real feeling of beauty to the lessons. And while he doesn't have the same fierceness during Jesus' frustrations as Robert Powell did, we can feel his frustration when he gets annoyed.\n\nThe sorrowful Good Friday scenes are certainly nowhere near as brutal as the ones in \"The Passion.\" But we still get the idea of how much Jesus is suffering. And the glorious events of Easter Sunday are beautifully done.\n\nLike I said, if you don't have 6 1/2 hours to watch the phenomenal \"Jesus of Nazareth,\" and you don't feel quite up to the brutality of 'The Passion,\" this 1979 Brian Deacon film is a perfect alternative.\n\nAnother thing I should point out is that \"The Passion\" is NOT child friendly. \"Jesus of Nazareth\" is in the middle. It's certainly nowhere near the brutality of \"The Passion.\" But 6 1/2 hours may be too much to show some children. One great thing about this film with Brian Deacon is that it is really child friendly. The lessons are there and drawn accurately from \"Luke.\" And the suffering of Good Friday is there, but not overdone  as in \"The Passion.\"\n\nAnother thing that makes this film good for children is that most of the footage is taken from the simply (but also beautifully) written \"Good News Bible.\"\n\nI like \"Jesus of Nazareth\" and \"The Passion.\" And I can suggest this film as well without reservation.", "summary": "Beautiful Masterpiece, Yet Child Friendly Too.", "unixReviewTime": 1396569600}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "03 30, 2014", "reviewerID": "A295VGM5LXQTTU", "asin": "0006486576", "style": {"Format:": " VHS Tape"}, "reviewerName": "casey7207", "reviewText": "It was a moving movie about Jesus.

Rather than let his law define us and how we should live, we take our own limited and broken experience and apply it to Jesus from which we derive expectations of Him. We rail against Him when these expectations are not met, and applaud smugly when they are. What we forget is that Jesus is God, and that He has surpassed anything that we could ever expect. He is greater than our expectations. When I look at my own life, I realize that all the sadness and misery I've experienced has resulted from putting my hopes and expecations in things that are not of God. The Bible tells us that whatever does not come from God is not good, and yet I place my trust in it anyway. In my sin, I desire a quick, selfish satisfaction, and I expect that coming from things I can measure. This much money, or these many relationships, or this much time spent on mindless entertainment. Whatever entertains me for a duration of time, however superficial it may be, I'll devote myself to because it's what I arbitrarily want. But I'm never satisfied completely or without guilt after I seek to please myself and not God. What I forget is that I have a Savior who came to give life and life abundantly. What Jesus has given us goes beyond measure. All we have to do is surrender to Him. Give up our life in idolatry and sin, which only leads to death, and turn to Jesus, the light of the world and source of life abundant. I know why Jesus is Saviour, and in recognition of that, desire him to be Lord of my life. I cannot 'rate' him, because I'm not worthy but hope that he will rate me as one of His own, so that I may one day hear God say to me, \"Well done, my good and faithful servant\".\nIn Christ,\n Brad Robinson", "summary": "Lord and Savior", "unixReviewTime": 1367971200}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "2", "verified": true, "reviewTime": "05 4, 2013", "reviewerID": "A1D0NIUKIJ54UW", "asin": "0006486576", "style": {"Format:": " DVD"}, "reviewerName": "mohawkjim", "reviewText": "We had an original VCR which we watched over and over.

Now I am a fan. My siblings and I grew up agreeing with Jesus of Nazareth as our favorite Jesus movie, esp because Robert Powell was the closest to how we think Jesus could've been like. His scrawny body would be how Jesus might've looked like from the physical mental spiritual exercises he had to go through. Robert Powell's soulful eyes and his acting was good. This movie on the other hand came off as a retro-ish 70's 80's kinda because of the hairstyle and the sound, and the accent was distinctly something else, but this surprisingly turned out to be REALLY good. The Jesus here is more spontaneous in his actions. He laughs. When he speaks, he teaches, it's like effortless. Yet the words are powerful. You could imagine Jesus. There are so many scenes and scripts in this movie that impressed on me. I have heard them before but hearing it the way the apostle had written (forgot which apostle, and I had lent this dvd to a new friend and hadn't gotten in back in a while so I had forgotten.

I appreciate that the director allows children to play roles in the movie, for Jesus loved children.  Not like today, where people claim that \"they are for the children\" but then vote for politicians who saddle the children with an unbearable debt.  At the end of giving the parable about the good Samaritan, Jesus asks \"who acted as this man's neighbor?\" and a small child answers.  In Luke's gospel, a grown man answers, however the slight changing of events do not bother me since the message remains the same.\n\nIn the film you will often hear background voices.  For example there is the occasion where a poor old lady deposits two small copper coins into the Temple treasury, since all she had were those two coins.  As she is doing this, you can hear people in the background commenting, in cockneyed accents, \"only a mite?\" \"can't she give more?\" \"it's very little.\"  These sayings are not documented in the gospel but again, do not detract from the message; rather they emphasize our own sinful nature and our need to repent.", "summary": "I am writing to you, most excellent Theophilus...", "unixReviewTime": 1208044800}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "07 12, 2007", "reviewerID": "A1CYHWARDJV4ZR", "asin": "0006486576", "style": {"Format:": " DVD"}, "reviewerName": "W.

The producers of this movie did painstaking research for many years, and they sought to be accurate in the little details, not only of the clothing and village life, but the ways the people talked and recited the prayers.  The filmmakers sought and succeeded in making a very accurate depiction of the life of Christ as taught in the Holy Bible.\n\nThe Jesus Film has been seen by over 4.7 billion people in 236 nations and thousands of people have accepted Christ as their personal Savior through this remarkable movie.  More people have watched this movie than any other movie in history. It is based on the Gospel of Luke and sticks very closely to the biblical text. (There is very little outside interpretation or extraneous material.)  This is its most valuable asset.  Watching this movie is like taking a picturesque tour of the Gospel of Luke.\n\nBrian Deacon is a charismatic and believable Jesus. He speaks with authority.  He also displays different emotions -- he smiles and treats children with great affection; he is stern toward the religious leaders and hypocrites.  He also displays sadness and grief.  Brian Deacon also looks like a man in his 30's, which Jesus was when He began His earthly ministry after being a carpenter for so many years.\n\nMany of the familiar scenes are depicted in this movie (The Birth, the Baptism, the Teachings, Healings, Trials, Suffering, Death and Resurrection).  There are certain scenes in the Gospel of Luke which are  depicted in this movie which don't appear in other Jesus films except the Gospel of Matthew - Visual Bible (e.g. The Transfiguration,  The healing of the Gadarene demoniac;  Jesus' praying in Gethsemane and sweating drops of blood, then being strengthened by the angel).\n\nWhat is so useful about this movie is that it is dubbed very precisely in so many languages.  This particular DVD features the spoken languages of English, Arabic, French, Japanese, Korean, Portugese, Mandarin (Chinese), and Spanish.  The subtitles are done in English, Spanish, French, Portugese, and Arabic.  If you look at the wonderful behind-the-scenes documentary of how the movie was dubbed, you'll see that they selected trained experts to read the text in the native language and they timed it to the milli-second to make it precisely right.  So, when Jesus speaks, it looks and sounds as if He is speaking the native language.\n\nThere are wonderful Special Features in this DVD:\n\nBesides Direct Scene Access, there is a documentary of Knowing Jesus Personally, where the gospel message is presented and the teachings of Jesus are explained.  There is the Behind-the-Scenes look at how the film was made.  There is also a Tribute to Jesus from people like George Bush, Larry King, David Copperfield, Billy Graham, Mother Theresa, and others.\n\nThere is also a bonus DVD of the story of Jesus for Children.\n\nEven though the acting may not be up to par as Hollywood, they do a good enough job.  The biggest plus of this movie is how faithful it is to the biblical text. An added plus at the end of the film is a complete and clear presentation of the Gospel message.\n\nI bought several copies of this DVD for my friends and church members and they have found it very useful.  I enjoy watching this movie over and over again.

The Jesus movie is a good introduction to his life and teachings but by no means comprehensive (for that you need the Bible).\nIf you're sincere in your search for the Truth, I highly recommend reading Josh McDowell's book, More Than a Carpenter, as an easy first read.

It has helped win innumerable souls to Christ all over the world, and even now, under the aegis of Campus Crusade For Christ, local churches and individuals are coming together in an effort to send a free copy of the movie to every home in the United States.  The movie was a dream over three decades in the making, with five years of pre-production work preceding the seven-month filming that took place in 1978 at a multitude of sites in Israel.  Intense efforts, involving the collaboration of numerous scholars from the whole gamut of Christian churches, went into making Jesus as accurate as it could possibly be - from vintage pottery to historically accurate costuming to sufficient cinders residing behind burning torches, every effort was made to take the audience back to Jesus' time.  It is a non-denominational Christian film; while some churches might quibble about an omission here or a suggestion there, this movie is the story of Jesus and not the story of any particular kind of Christian religion.\nThe movie is based solely on the Gospel of Luke, and the dialogue you hear is taken straight out of the Bible.  Jesus says nothing in this film that He does not say in Luke's account of his life.  Naturally, every facet of Jesus' life could not be covered here, but the movie does a superb job of showing us who Jesus was and how He lived, taught, suffered, and died for the sins of all humanity.  Brian Deacon does a superb job playing Jesus, and Niko Nitai truly shines in his portrayal of Simon Peter.  At times, the film does seem to jump from one scene to another rather quickly, but this goes back to the authenticity upon which the film was founded.  In a sense, Jesus' ministry was spent walking toward Jerusalem and His death on the cross, so we see Jesus and his disciples walking almost continuously; furthermore, Jesus' teachings, as recorded in Luke's Gospel, are a collection of parables and religious instruction originating from many different events in the life of the Savior.  Jesus took His message to the people instead of letting the people come to Him.\nThe suffering of Jesus is handled quite well here, clearly portraying the horrific nature of death by crucifixion without making it disturbing enough to scare young children.  You do see the scourging of Jesus and the driving of the nails into his wrists and feet, but the director seemed to set just the right tone for the scenes.  It all makes for a powerful film that has won innumerable souls across the world; to tell someone of Jesus is one thing, but to show that person in such a captivating format as film exactly who Jesus was and how He suffered and died for the sins of humanity makes for a powerful missionary tool.

It is a different story, and has nothing to do with the original Frosty TV Special. First of all it is made by a different studio, with different animators, directors, and voices. The director is Bill Melendez, who directed all of the Charlie Brown, Snoopy, and Peanuts specials, so it looks like a Peanuts cartoon. Made in 1992. The voice acting features Jonathon Winters, and it has John Goodman as Frosty. The songs are original and pretty fun. The plot is centered on the folks in town that want clean streets in winter by getting all the snow removed. The kids and Frosty are in a panic and fight back or else they will lose all their snow fun - and snow men. If you approach this show knowing it is not the sequel and is from the team that made the Peanuts shows, you will be OK.\n\nIF YOU ARE ALSO INTERESTED IN THE REAL SEQUEL: The studio that made the first hour long Frosty special that first aired on CBS television in 1969 is Rankin/Bass Productions, the kings of holiday specials. That show was based on the original song written in 1951 by Steve nelson and Jack Rollins. The studio made a terrific half hour sequel in 1976 for ABC television titled \"Frosty's Winter Wonderland\".  That special starts right where the first one left off.  The basic premise of the story is that Frosty gets a wife named Crystal (played by Shelley Winters), and is sabotaged by the jealous Jack Frost. The character design was by Paul Coker Jr., who did the same work for the first special, so the visual continuity works very well and the characters have that classic Rankin/Bass 'look'. He also did the unique lettering for the credits in both specials. The famous voice actor Paul Frees stars as Jack Frost, and the policeman. Frees was a regular in studio productions and had also voiced the policeman, ticket seller, and Santa Claus in the original. Jackie Vernon voiced Frosty just like he did before. The writer for both Rankin/Bass shows was Romeo Muller, and Maury Laws returned as the musical director. Interestingly, while Rankin/Bassis known for the high quality of their original songs, they used Christmas standards in their sequel.  The major change in the sequel from the original is a big one, the narrator, and it can be unsettling if you watch them back to back.  While the first show was narrated and sung by Jimmy Durante, the second time we had the voice talents of Andy Griffith. Nothing against Andy, but it is a big change.\n\nAND ANOTHER SEQUEL: Another sequel of sorts was made by Rankin/Bass with the same production team, it is a theatrical feature length movie released in 1979 titled \"Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July\".", "summary": "Not the real Frosty sequel- see \"Frosty's Winter Wonderland\" for real sequel", "unixReviewTime": 1133827200}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "5", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "11 30, 1999", "reviewerID": "A2SHK2Q0X0SOW2", "asin": "0307142493", "style": {"Format:": " VHS Tape"}, "reviewerName": "Amazon Customer", "reviewText": "Santa Claus is coming to town is one of the best christmas movies ever.

One of them was the stop motion classic Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town.  Nope, I'd never even heard of it before, but I found it pretty fun.\n\nAs the special opens, we run into a mail man (voiced by Fred Astaire) who is delivering letters to Santa.  He decides to tell us all about Santa.\n\nIt starts many years ago when a baby was left in the care of the Burgermeister Meisterburger (Paul Frees).  Being the mean guy that he is, Burgermeister throws the baby out.  But he winds up in the care of a family of elves named Kringle who happen to be toy makers.\n\nThe baby grows into a man named Kris (Mickey Rooney) who decides to deliver the toys that his family makes to share the joy with kids everywhere.  But when he returns to his home village, he finds that the Burgermeister Meisterburger has outlawed all toys.  As a result of defying the ban, Kris becomes a wanted fugitive.  Can he find a way to bring joy to the kids of the village?  And what about the Winter Warlock (Keenan Wynn) who lives between the Kringles and the village?\n\nTo be honest, I wasn't expecting much from this special, and I'm not quite sure why.  Maybe my low expectations were why this one surprised me so much.  I actually got quite caught up in the story even though I had most of it figured out early.  The characters were so great, too, from Kris to his adopted family and his love interest Jessica (Robie Lester) on the good side to the villain you love to hate, Burgermeister Meisterburger.\n\nI'm not a big fan of stop motion animation.  It looks too jerky to me most of the time.  That was certainly the case here, but I actually found it charming.  Maybe I'm softening in my old age.\n\nOne drawback to this short is the music.  Outside of the title song (which Fred Astaire sings so well), all the songs were unfamiliar to me.  Frankly, they didn't add much.  In fact, I found myself wanting to fast forward through them to get back to the story.\n\nNot helping at all was how dated the musical segments were.  This special was released in 1970, and it shows.  I got a definite flower power vibe off the animation during the songs.  There were a couple of other times I felt a bit of that crept into the story.  You might also describe it as psychedelic.  My roommate found this aspect even more annoying than I did; I was mostly able to ignore it and get lost in the story again when it was over.\n\nKids, the target audience, won't notice how dated this is.  In fact, they'll find the 50 minutes over all too quickly.  Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town, and he's doing it with plenty of charm to entertain for years to come.", "summary": "Have Questions about Santa?

Share the magic of this original Christmas classic told and sung by Fred Astaire! Narrated by Fred Astaire.\n\nVoice Cast: Fred Astaire, Mickey Rooney, Keenan Wynn, Paul Frees, Joan Gardner, Robie Lester, Andrea Sacino, Dina Lynn, Gary White, Greg Thomas and The Westminster Childrens Choir (Final Chorus)\n\nDirectors: Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass\n\nProducers: Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass\n\nScreenplay: Romeo Muller\n\nComposer: Jules Bass and Maury Laws\n\nVideo Resolution: 1080p\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.33:1 [4:3]\n\nAudio: English: 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio\n\nSubtitles: None\n\nRunning Time: 48:40 minutes\n\nRegion: Region B/2\n\nNumber of discs: 1\n\nStudio: ClassicMedia / Studio: Universal Pictures UK\n\nAndrew's Blu-ray Review: `Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town' was originally a 1970 stop motion television special, made by Rankin-Bass. The film stars actor Fred Astaire as the narrator S.D. Kluger, Mickey Rooney as Kris Kringle/Santa Claus, Keenan Wynn as the Winter Warlock, and Paul Frees in various roles. The film tells the story of how Santa Claus and several Claus-related Christmas traditions came to be. It is based on the hit Christmas song of the same name, which was introduced on radio by Eddie Cantor in 1934, and the story of Saint Nicholas.\n\nThe special was created using stop motion animation called \"Animagic,\" in which all the characters are made out of wood and plastic and animated via stop-motion photography. The special was originally telecast December 14, 1970 by ABC and continues to air every year on sibling channel ABC Family, though both channels have at times edited the special to make room for commercials (ABC has cut two key songs, as well as two other songs in half; ABC Family has cut several scenes that might be traumatizing to younger viewers, like Kris climbing, and leaping to escape to prevent children from doing dangerous stunts, Winter Warlock knowing Kris will return, & telling him he'll never escape including the scene where the Burgermeister Meisterburger character torches the seized toys in front of the children of Sombertown).\n\n`Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town' was written by Rankin-Bass' go-to writer, Romeo Muller, who explores all aspects of Santa Claus' origins. Narrated by a mailman named Kluger [Fred Astaire], this hour-long special dissects the development of Kris' selflessness, and covers the origins of his beard, hearty laugh, crew of helpers, need to go down the chimney, North Pole residency (he needs to hide from Burgermeister, after all), and pretty much everything in between, providing a hugely creative look at how Santa came to be. On top of being edifying, it's wonderfully entertaining too, full of delightful set-pieces and tender moments of humour.\n\nWhereas today's film makers use 3D computer animation, `Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town' was executed with stop-motion technology, using models and sets to painstakingly create each frame. It does look dated and rough at times, not to mention the pacing does occasionally drag, but there's something charming about this primitive technique, especially when you consider just how much work went into every second of screen-time. Rankin-Bass movies often featured impressive casts, with the pair securing at least one or two major names for each production. `Santa Claus is Comin' to Town' has two big names, with Mickey Rooney and Fred Astaire both lending their vocal talents to the film. Astaire is a huge asset, guiding us through the story with energy and charm. He has a great singing voice, too, which enlivens the numerous musical set-pieces. Mickey Rooney, meanwhile, submits well-judged work with plenty of heart.\n\nFor over four decades now, `Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town' has been part of annual Christmastime traditions in many households, but mainly in North America, and deservingly so. Romeo Muller's screenplay covers the origins of many holiday traditions - including hiding gifts in stockings and how reindeer fly, while also delivering an uplifting reminder about the real meaning of the season of giving.\n\nBlu-ray Video Quality - This 40th Anniversary Blu-Ray release of `Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town' features a full 1080p High Definition presentation utilising the 1.33:1 [4:3] Standard Aspect Ratio in which it was originally broadcast. The video presentation looks pretty outstanding for a TV special especially for its age and all of the colours and detail look spot on, easily the best this classic family TV special event has ever been presented. Fans of this TV special should be thrilled with this high definition video presentation and the newcomers to it couldn't possibly find a better way to experience it for the first time. Because it was original made for North America Television, you can see where the adverts were inserted, because you see it fade out, with such a Classic Christmas Special transferred to the Blu-ray format, you think they could of made and effort to edit it in a much more professional way and got hold of the original master tape? I suspect when people viewed this on the DVD format, you would not see the black strings holding up the puppets. But now seeing it in the video resolution of 1080p, you can see very clearly the black string, still after a while you forget seeing this anomaly.\n\nBlu-ray Audio Quality - While it states that the main soundtrack is 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, we are instead treated to a  5.1 channel Dolby Digital soundtrack which isn't too shabby and it's certainly a pleasant surprise to find a multichannel soundtrack of any sort present for such an old special. While as one would expect, the surround element may not provide much in the way of background effects, the special sounds are pretty great here nonetheless and I think overall most will be pretty satisfied with this 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, especially if you have not got the facility of a Home Cinema set-up.\n\nBlu-ray Special Features and Extras:\n\nSadly none has been provided.\n\nFinally, amongst Christmas specials, but particularly amongst those produced by Rankin and Bass, `Santa Claus is Comin' to Town' stands apart. It does so because it is most the most triumphantly well-told of the lot, soon I will describe the most cinematic but here we're talking strictly based on narrative. This may just be Romeo Muller's, the writer Rankin/Bass employed, best work as he makes Santa an even more heroic figure because in this tale we learn of his past, learn to think of him as a person not just an icon, and then also have an antagonist who vilifies him and renders him an outlaw. You have, of course, the talents of Fred Astaire and Mickey Rooney in this tale and the indelible figures of the Winter Warlock and Bergermeister Meisterberger and of course another classic song. It is an absolutely unbeatable combination and one of the best options for the festive season. Highly Recommended!\n\nAndrew C.

Fred Astaire proved added another dimension to his legendary career as one of the best narrators in any special. Mickey Rooney's bravado was ideal for the young Kris Kringle. Keenan Wynn's Winter Warlock was memorable (especially when he gets the choo-choo). And our beloved Robie Lester (read Mouse Tracks for more about her) was the show-stopper when, as Jessica, she undid the proverbial bun and belted out her solo, a great tune in a score that hasn't a dud in the bunch (though sadly, in today's more creepy times, \"Be Prepared to Pay\" may seem to take on an odd -- thoroughly unintentional -- connotation).\n\nSanta Claus is Comin' to Town is so spectacular that it's the visual crown jewel in the trilogy with Rudolph and Frosty. And sure, it adds yet another set of myths to confuse those trying to figure out the origin of Santa.\n\nIn this case, the story springs from the mind of writer Romeo Muller, but I wonder if, like Rudolph, this special contains a nod to its cultural context. In 1970, Richard Nixon was president, the war was raging and the counterculture was questioning. Kris and Jessica become outlaws and get married in a forest like hippies (since no town would welcome them), and the Burgermeister does resemble Nixon a little. I even noticed that, when Kris says \"It's not even safe here,\" they're standing among the burned remains of what might have been their small camp -- we get a quick glimpse and then it's gone with no other mention. This is the story of Santa as a revolutionary against political oppression.\n\nOkay, enough with the term paper hypotheses. This is Rankin/Bass at their best and glows like a shimmering holiday display on Blu-Ray.

Here we have Fred Astaire narrating and singing a couple of songs in this 1970 stop-motion retelling of the origins of Santa Claus.  Fred's a mailman delivering letters from kids to Santa, and he stops to answer some questions in the charming opening credits sequence which quotes most of the musical themes from the 50 minute TV special, first broadcast when I was 5.  Santa was an orphan left on the doorstep of the mean Burgermeister Meisterburger (I still love that name) in Sombretown (ok that's a little corny) with merely the word \"Claus\" on a chain around his neck.  The Burgermeister is a mean old dude and doesn't want him, and through mysterious, fortuitous circumstances he ends up with the Kringle elves in the Mountains of the Whispering Winds.  He grows up learning to make toys, befriends all the animals of the forest, and goes back to Sombretown to give toys to the kids - but is met by the Burgermeister's opposition.  Along the way the reasons for the red suit, the flying reindeer, the belly laugh, etc, are all explained, with the voices of kids breaking into Astaire's narration at times to ask him to verify that this was, in fact, how it happened.  Kinda cool even for this adult.\n\nThis was along with RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER my favorite holiday special as a kid, though it has faded for me somewhat over the years; I guess I remember the romance between Santa and schoolteacher Jessica (Mrs Claus eventually, of course) as more mawkish and sappy than it was, and I'd forgotten that the fairly dreadful \"My World is Beginning Today\" is full of cool 60s hippie/flower people imagery.  The early parts of the story are really fairly dark and bleak, and it's interesting that, though the Burgermeister has a moment where he harks back to childhood, he never reforms and we leave him still villainous, like Potter in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.  The story - original to this film I think - seems a bit influenced by L. Frank Baum's \"The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus\" in the pagan/natural nature of Santa as we see him early on; but at the end a specifically Christian element enters the picture.  Apart from the love song I already mentioned, the rest of the music is pretty good, with \"Put One Foot In Front of the Other\" probably the most memorable; it still gives me a lump in my throat.\n\nIn addition to Astaire, the voice talents include Keenan Wynn as Winter, the magician who rules the mountains and tries to stop Claus but is quickly befriended by him; professional voice actor Paul Frees as the Burgermeister and others; and Mickey Rooney as Kringle/Santa Claus, a role he would repeat in THE YEAR WITHOUT A SANTA CLAUS.  All are very solid, especially Wynn, an underrated actor and a great vocal talent.  Overall this was definitely more fun than I remembered it from my last viewing, probably a decade ago - though RUDOLPH I suspect will always rule my inner child's heart.", "summary": "Rankin/Bass classic is near the top of their game", "unixReviewTime": 1261612800}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "01 26, 2009", "reviewerID": "A1YUOGDE7FAWGM", "asin": "0307142493", "style": {"Format:": " DVD"}, "reviewerName": "Michelle Estep", "reviewText": "What a great classic story of the tale of Santa Clause.

It will always keep the whole family entertained.  A young man named Kris is determined that the children in a drab village will finally have fun.\n\nUnder dictatorial rule of the Burgermeister Meisterburger (obviously hammed by Paul Frees), all forms of fun have been outlawed in Sombertown. Consequently it is a really bleak place for people to grow up. This is reinforced by everything being painted in greys and blacks. Kris believes that children's living in this harsh environment is unjust--and plans to do something about it.\n\nVarious facets of the Santa Claus legend have come about (at least according to this particular screenplay) from strategies which Kris and his friends had to develop in order to triumph over the oppressive government.  In this version of the story, Santa Claus is a countercultural radical (also in keeping with the 1960's anti-authoritarian motif which original audiences were themselves living through). The future Santa Claus is a thoughtful young man who was raised by elves as one of their own. They did not even mind he was human!\n\nDetermined to reach the children of Sombertown, Kris is aided by his girlfriend turned wife Jessica, who is also innovative and brave. Also opposing cruelty and facism, Jessica is no shrinking violet herself. She is the perfect partner for Kris because both want a world of love, happiness, and fairness. Again, keeping with the era this special was made, Santa Claus is presented as a free-spirit instead of an excuse for rampant commercialism.\n\nWhether this screenplay is actually true, seeing Santa Claus as a young man has always been very interesting.

After some introductory comments from the mailman, who delivers to the North Pole in a snowcat type vehicle, we see the credits spelled out on mail envelopes, with a stamp representing the actor listed. Inside the envelopes are question from children around the world about Santa. \"Where did Santa's suit come from?\", and more, so that the show can proceed to show where Santa got his start and why things are the way they are. In a sad vilage named Sombertown, ruthlessly run by the Burgermeister Meisterberger, toys are outlawed. On the other side of the mountain, elves are raising a human orphan boy, learned in the ways of toymaking. But a scary Winter Warlock has prevented them from delivering toys across the mountain. Whenthe boy grows up he is givent he name Kris Kringle, and he determines to deliver the toys. Arriving there he meets Ms. Jessica and falls in love, but Kris is arrested for the toys. After his escape he runs into the Winter Warlock, and must find a way to deal with him if he is going to deliver toys. Without giving any plot away, Kris has to find creative ways to smeak the toys to the children and avoid being captured again by the soldiers. Along the way we see how traditions like hanging stockings, using the chimney, delivering at night, making reindeer fly, and a nice/naughty list got their start.\n\nBEHIND THE SCENES:Rankin/Bass studios was the most prolific creators of holiday specials we have ever known. After the huge success of their 1964 stop motion musical Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, they created no less than 14 more Christmas specials, from a total of 35 specials of which many covered other holidays.

It all has to do with the evil Burgermeister Meisterburger (voiced by Paul Frees) of Sombertown, who had outlawed toys. Of course, that is heresy to Kris Kringle, the abandoned baby who was left with the toy making Kringle family. With the help of a penguin, the Winter Warlock (Keenan Wynn), and Jessica (Robie Lester), the local school marm, Kris saves the day and comes up with all of the symbols that have been associated with the legend of Santa Claus.\n\nProduced by Jules Bass and Arthur Rankin Jr., \"Santa Claus is Comin' to Town\" features an above average songs by Maury Laws to go along with J. Fred Coots' inspirational classic \"Santa Claus is Comin' To Town.\" These include \"First Toymaker To the King,\" \"Be Prepared to Pay (Santa's Song),\" \"Put One Foot in Front of the Other,\" \"My World is Beginning Today,\" and \"What Better Way to Tell You (Christmas Carol).\" Of course, the title song is saved for last and Astaire makes you think it has always been your song.\n\nThe story is told by a mailman, effectively voiced by Fred Astaire, who takes time out from all of his holiday deliveries to set the tone for this charming holiday tale and narrate the evetns. I think of this as being a contemporary of \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,\" but that actually came out six years earlier (the common denominator is that they were both clay-mation productions from Bass & Rankin).

I only mention this so that readers will be able to gauge my review of this classic based on my age. While I was growing up, prior vcr tapes and dvd players, I and my friends would wait all year to view the various Christmas specials that aired each year. I remember sitting glued to the tv taking in every second of the shows. Back then if you missed part of the show or even the whole show you were border line depressed because you knew you couldn't see it again for a whole year. In some ways anticipation made the viewing of Christmas specials that much better.\nSANTA CLAUS IS COMIN' TO TOWN(SCICTT) is in my top five Rankin/Bass specials. Right along with RUDOLPH, FROSTY and The Year WITHOUT SANTA CLAUS. I enjoy the 1970's feel this classic has. The flowers that appear when Jessica sings, the simple toys the kids play with and the songs that are sung throughout this show. I can only imagine what a modern version of this show would sound like with its boy band sounding songs and electric toys and video games. Instead of watching Kris and Jessica court each other and wed we would probably see them live together while they consider marriage.\nThis was a scary classic. The Winter Warlock was very scary when I viewed this as a kid. No matter how many times I saw this as a kid I would always wonder if Kris would make it past the warlock.\nI suppose the best thing about this type of Christmas classic is that when people my age view it they can escape back to their innocent youth for a short while.

Watch the delightful changes of the Winter Worlock from mean and evil to mellow and fun.\nAll the animation is smooth and precise giving the excellent illusion that these figures are actually alive.\nThe songs are excellent, from the familiar \"Santa Claus is Coming To Town\" to the lovely \"My World Is Beginning Today\" sung by Jessica, the future Mrs. Santa. (For some strange reason, this delightful song is often cut when this production is shown on TV, luckily it is included in the tape.)\nThe script couldn't be better giving explanations for most of the Santa legends such as how he got his name, how reindeer can fly, why he comes down chimneys and fills stockings. It can make a believer out of even Ebenezer Scrooge.\nThis has been my absolute favorite Christmas video since I first saw it many years ago on TV. It was one of the reasons I bought my first VCR so I could make a tape of it before it was commercially available. I even have an old LP recording of the complete show.

First, the presenter. Oh dear. OH DEAR. I am sure he's a great guy and all, but a presenter fit for filming he simply is not. His attempts to appear spontaneous and unscripted make him look VERY silly. VERY SILLY. You can see straight through it as clear as day. This ties in with the cinematography. Each presenter is teaching an invisible person. The camera angles follow the person if they are walking, or still, slightly to the side of the person. But where is the person the presenter is talking to? Oh my gosh. EYE CONTACT. They never eyeball the camera. It makes you feel very weird. I have never seen anything filmed like this. So the whole entire time you're watching you just want to see who the HECK are you talking to? but you never see, because there isn't anyone, and it is insanely frustrating. So it's like the presenters are talking to you, but they NEVER look at you. Argh. It's an exercise in patience as it just makes you want to slap the guy and say, \"HEY, I'm over HERE, LOOK at me\". The way I am expressing it, it doesn't sound like a big deal, but watch it and you'll find out. Imagine watching Katie Kuric on the evening news, but she's looking to the diagonal all the time, never at you, you'd want to slap the TV.\n\nAnother problem is the continual stop-start nature of the teachings. Every few minutes you need to hit play to keep going.\n\nMy second serious gripe is the way they have encoded the DVD. Clearly the DVD producer didn't know how to create scripts in the project because every chapter has been saved as a title. This means ripping the DVD to watch on your AppleTV or iPod, computer etc is impossible. To some this will not matter, but for me it's a big issue.\n\nI am sure the teaching is great, if only I could stand to watch it, which I just can't.

Kudos to Zondervan and Matt Williams.\n\nWe selected this series for our new small group.  My wife and I have been involved in multiple small groups for the past thirty years.  I have often found small group material shallow and unchallenging.  Everyone in our group finds this series exceptional on multiple levels.  First, the quality of the material is superb because each lesson is taught by seminary professor who is speaking in his area of expertise.  Second, the format of splitting each video lesson into three parts is very effective.  I was weary of this before we started, wondering how it would logistically work in the group, and how the whole thing would flow.  However, we have found that it works very well, allowing you to discuss the points of each sub-teaching before going on to the next section that builds upon the prior one: Historical context, deeper dive into the meaning, and application.  You just have to be disciplined to keep on schedule.  Third, the personal application (focus of the third video section) and the attending questions are focused, deep, and easily personalized.  Fourth, I have found powerful little nuggets of truth in text boxes inserted in the study guide of each lesson.\n\nWe relocated to South Carolina in May 2012 and we're new to the church we're attending.  I have to say, this new small group is the deepest, most mature small group we have ever been a part of as a couple.  Although our group is very mature, I don't at all think this material is only suitable for more mature, deeply committed followers of Jesus.  Its value is not that it is intellectually deep and challenging, but rather that its deep insights are so well developed, well presented, and easily understood.  I think this material will be equally beneficial to anyone willing to sit and participate - from questioning seekers to mature followers of Jesus.\n\nTo A.I. who tossed out the entire series based on dislike for the directors decision to have the speakers not look into the camera as they presented: an epic tossing of the baby with the bath water.\n\nOur group has decided to continue with the Deeper Connection series after this one.", "summary": "Perhaps the Best Series I've Ever Used", "unixReviewTime": 1362268800}, {"overall": 2.0, "vote": "2", "verified": true, "reviewTime": "01 30, 2013", "reviewerID": "A3MHLV4W1KKP3E", "asin": "0310271908", "style": {"Format:": " DVD"}, "reviewerName": "Amazon Customer", "reviewText": "Information was good but had trouble when none of the speakers ever looked at the cameras.

Accurate, encouraging, and challenging applications of the Bible's message to life today\n\nEach volume is accompanied by a Participant Guide which is available separately allowing participants to make deeper connections with a knowledge of historical background of the Bible, biblical text, and real life applications.\n\n'The Parables of Jesus: Six In-depth Studies Connecting the Bible to Life' is one of the volumes of the Deeper Connections series focusing on parables of Jesus.

The guide (or presenter) is actually over in Israel as he introduces each teaching, thus helping bring the text and teachings to life.  Simply getting a glimpse of where Jesus walked, taught, etc. helped me to connect to the text in new ways.  Moreover, his presentations were not cheesy, but informative and natural.\n\nIA may not like the lack of eye contact, but we personally thought it was insightful (plus, why give a 1/5 stars for something like that?).

This time he drives through Israel in a Fiat, traveling the roads to the places of Jerusalem, Masada, Samaria, Shiloh, and Beersheeba, just to name a few.\n\nAs I watched these movies, I had several \"ah hah\" moments, as I connected the words of the Bible with the places Dave visited. I was able to put a visual with the accounts in the Bible, including the place where David slayed Goliath and the place where Jesus met the Samaritan woman at the well. The archeological evidence is astounding! My favorite part was seeing the place where the Dead Sea Scrolls were found and then finding out a bit about the men who discovered the amazing scrolls while herding sheep.\n\nPerfect for families, homeschoolers, youth groups, and anyone who loves history, especially Biblical and ancient history, these newest volumes of Drive Thru History are a must have for any DVD library. There is nothing objectionable in either volume, although young children may not yet be interested. Also, the brief information about David slaying Goliath may scare very young viewers if they are not familiar with the account.\n\nI highly recommend these latest volumes in the Drive Thru History saga and have added it to my listing of mom-approved movies for families on my wordpress blog.\n\nReviewed by Penny Zeller, Author of \"77 Ways Your Family Can Make a Difference: Ideas and Activities for Serving Others.\"", "summary": "Another highly-recommended Drive Thru History!", "unixReviewTime": 1330473600}, {"overall": 5.0, "verified": true, "reviewTime": "02 21, 2015", "reviewerID": "A3UUJTO6G6LPR7", "asin": "0310396336", "style": {"Format:": " DVD"}, "reviewerName": "Laura L.
