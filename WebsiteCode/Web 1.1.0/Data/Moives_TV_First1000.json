Once you get past the late 80s/early 90s clothing and hair styles, the DVD is fun. I purchased this for my 3 year old as the whole family loves volume 1. Some observations:\n1. Compared to Volume 1, the verse selection is a little weak but still profitable. Volume 1 verses are readily applicable to a young child and understood. Volume 2 verses are best understood with a little more context, so perhaps a slightly older child who already knows some Bible.\n2. Vocal ranges: As a former music teacher, I tend to be very picky about vocal ranges for children. In general, D to D is best. This volume has multiple songs that go lower briefly. Still, it's not nearly as low as a lot of the children's music I hear coming out now.\n3. Pitch: Several of the songs feature children who aren't quite on pitch. In the video, you see the child in context and it's cute. But on the CD, it jarring to my ears. If it were just at the end of a song as a cute touch, it wouldn't be bad, but having an out-of-tune singer lead a song is just painful. Now, this probably would not drive the average non-musician crazy at all, so take this comment with a grain of salt.\n4. Song complexity: In volume 1, the song was first presented in its simplest form and then repeated with added complexity. In volume 2, the complexity is sometimes brought in at the beginning. This is just fine for a slightly older child.\n\nEven with these critiques, I am pleased with this CD/DVD. My daughter loves it, and I love that she's getting God's truth engrained into her heart.

I have many versions of it and always love seeing the various interpretations offered.  This one, however, continues to be one of my all time favorites.  The change of setting forces the film to explain elements of the book that most films overlook because they assume you're already familiar with the story.  Examples of this include how Scrooge (Slade in the film) could be so mean and yet think himself a just man, also the reason the ghost of his dead partner is miserable (not understanding the need to do good until he has lost the power).  Add to this the wonderful performances by Winkler et al and you've got an absolutely classic film.\nIn my opinion, this version of Dickens' story is closer to the original spirit of his work than many less derivative versions.

Unfortunately, the only thing holding this movie back was.... Henry Winkler.\n\nThe Fonz makes an awful Scrooge, or Slade, in this case. His acting isn't horrible, but it's also not that good. There seems very little emotion in his transition from corrupt, hateful, \"covetous old sinner\" to changed man, learning to care for others. He's stiff and seemingly insincere. (His interaction with the young boy at the end is a little creepy too. \"You're going to come for a ride with me.\" Ew.)\n\nHis character is too old looking... it looks like he could kick the bucket any moment (yet he runs around like a man quite a bit younger), and caused a disconnect and confusion while visiting with The Ghost of Christmas Past.\n\nI mean, it's not horrible, but I certainly didn't like it as much as many of the other Christmas Carol adaptations out there.\n\nIf you're looking to watch A Christmas Carol, I recommend the George C. Scott version for a wonderfully sarcastic Ghost of Christmas Present who gives Scrooge a good dose of his own medicine (however, the scene with Ignorance and Want may be scary to children*), or A Muppet Christmas Carol for a surprisingly touching musical adaptation- I promise the songs aren't too hokey.

Depalma", "reviewText": "Dickens writing is poetry of the highest order, and as a story teller he has few peers.  Henry Winkler's monotone delivery of the Christmas Carol combined with a trite and confusing screen play was only made worse by the frequent interruptions of a black screen, since this was an adaptation of a TV production in 1979 converted to a DVD.  The make-up in the movie was distracting to a fault, looking like it had been applied with a masonry trowel and topped by one of the worst hairpieces since George Burns was alive.\n\nAlthough the new Scrooge's premise had promise by changing the setting of the story from Victorian England to Depression Era America, the writers did not take advantage of the fairy tale capacities of the story and moral lessons, best taught as allegories.  In this sense having the four visitations (Marley, plus Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come) done in the context of real-life characters from the TV production itself, had a less dramatic impact on the events.  Simply stated, Marley should have been a tortured spirit, attempting to right a long life of wrong decisions instead of appearing like a characterized mobster from a B-movie.  In addition the 70's hipster, as Christmas Yet to Come, was several decades from being relevant to the plot, or as sinister, foreboding and silent as the representation of a lonely death.  Last, but not least, the conclusion of the story appeared rushed and lacked substance, more so than many versions I have seen. In this sense sending the young boy to Australia to cure his malady was more detail than I required and most likely confusing to anyone not familiar with the period in America.\n\nThis review (2012) is based on a recent watching of the video I purchased a number of years ago for my collection. However, if you are reading this you should understand the context in which the TV movie was made.  Winkler was at the height of his popularity from the Happy Days series when he portrayed this part, and in addition to his early success, has evolved into an accomplished actor, director, producer and author.

This is the perefect setting, the time and place are quite reminiscent of Dickens' London, so you don't have the distraction from making major changes. Aside from the setting, you have a fairly typical Christmas Carol. Sure, Henry Winkler's Benedict Slade doesn't go around saying bah humbug, nor does he have a nephew, but he's no different than Ebeneezer Scrooge. Nor is he a boy growing up in a boarding school (tyical for England at the time) hated by his father for his mother dying in childbirth, instead he's an orphan. Same impact, but appropriate for the time and place.\n\nAs a TV movie, its a bit lacking compared to other versions, the budget is more visible than typical, but wise use of settings and lesser TV actors help. While many of the supporting cast are familiar, none are stars of any sort, just standard supporting actors. The play like use of three of Slade's debtors to represent the three spirits works very well, giving their parts more weight and saving the production money, ditto for the reuse of sets when they're not outside. The ghost of Christmas future is the greatest departure from the original, after all, in this movie he can talk, and we actually see what he looks like. And his very dated arrival is a bit funnier than was intended, but that journey still carries weight.\n\nOver all, well done and believable without significantly rewriting a classic.

An excellent and original adaption.\n\nAn American Christmas Carol is a superb and original adaption of the Dickens Christmas classic. Henry Wrinkler stars as the Scrooge character, Benedict Slade. He does a great job as a hardnosed old man, and he does look convincing in aged make up. The story takes place in New England America, during the Great Depression.\n-An American Christmas Carol is unique in many ways. Slade doesn't believe he's evil or even a miser; he's just a practical businessman. On Christmas Eve he and his employee, Thatcher, go out in their truck to repossess items - to take back what is rightly his, Slade says. When carolers show up at Slade's door, he doesn't chase them away with a stick like Scrooge did, he congratulates them on their wonderful singing and offers them a present: A small book he printed up at his own expense on how to save money and make yourself a future.\n-Slade's deceased business partner Jack Latham appears and he offers some stunning quotes.\n\n\"Hell isn't what you think it is, devils with pitchforks, fire and brimstone.\"\n\"Thank God,\" Slade responds.\n\"It's worse,\" Latham says.\n\nA short while later Slade says \"But you were a man of business, Latham. You drove a hard bargain but you never did anything evil!\"\n\"Evil isn't just what you do,\" Latham replies, \"It's also what you DON'T do.\"\n\nA wonderful sentiment. The whole movie is full of incredible quotes and comments on generosity, history, a man's life, and a man's effect on the people and world around him.\n-As a unique feature I've never seen in any other adaption, the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future are played by Slade's customers, the very people he just repossessed items from. Slade actually believes them to be the same people, having broken into his warehouse. Until they provide a sample of their supernatural powers. The spirits are heralded by Slade's old radio broadcasting music and news from either the past or the future, even when it's unplugged.\n-Another unique thing is once Slade has seen the light and transformed into a better man, he is still a bit of a grump. As if the transformation isn't instantaneous and is still a work in progress. He is more generous, more concerned with the welfare of others, including the town, the unemployed, his employee Thatcher and his sick son, the orphanage where he once stayed at, but he has a very nice and realistic bite to him yet.\n-The movie comments on the Dickens work frequently. \"Did you read that book, Mister Slade?\" a bookseller asks, after Slade has reformed.\n\"The ghost of hell? The ghosts of Christmases Past, Present and Future? Complete and utter ... what was the word he used?\"\n\"Humbug?\"", "summary": "Original, Amrerican, Thought Provoking and Unique", "unixReviewTime": 1224892800}, {"overall": 4.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "08 2, 2008", "reviewerID": "A26UI3EHSMSHG6", "asin": "0005019281", "style": {"Format:": " DVD"}, "reviewerName": "Connie L.

Yet just fifteen years later, during the Great Depression, he's a very old man.  So what's the deal?  It seems as if the film's producers just happened to have a few WWI-era cars and costumes and posters hanging around, so they decided to twist time around to fit the props.  It doesn't make a whole lot of sense for Winkler's character to be a young boy in what seems to be the early-Industrial Revolution, then a young man during WWI, then a very old man during the Depression.  Very odd.\n\nI have to believe that if they hadn't had some WWI posters and banners and cars available, they would have cut out the War Bond Rally part and kept the continuity intact.  When Slade sees his gravestone, it appears that he was born in 1876- which would make him just over forty in the War Bond scene, and in his mid-fifties in 1933, when the film is supposed to be taking place.  Maybe it's because I'm a history teacher, but this part always bugged me.  Maybe they should have had everyone excited about the Spanish American War of 1898- that would have made a lot more sense, but they would have had to save the scenes with the cars for later. They could have placed the first scene at the end of the Civil War (that would have allowed for some nice props,) making his age in 1933 more believable.

Winkler is simply superb: believable, funny, dramatic, and imminently likable even as the curmudgeon. The supporting cast is wonderful as well even though most of them, with the possible exception of David Wayne, will be unknown to most viewers. The actor who plays Thatcher (the \"Cratchit\" character in the Dickens novel) does a wonderful job of being as compassionate as the role demands without being too \"soft\".\nThe actors playing the roles of Mr. Brewster and Helen Brewster also hold their own and give Winkler solid performances to react to even with limited screen time.\nThe movie looks and feels like I would imagine turn of the century and Depression era New England to look and feel like to an outsider: quaint, majestic, proud; yet tired and despairing.\nMy only problem with the movie, and this is REALLY nitpicking, is that they simply made Winkler look too old for the latter Slade (\"Scrooge\") part. the movie does an excellenet job of letting us know when things are happening, even in the Christmas Past scenarios, e.g., we know Slade and Helen broke up around 1917 because of the backdrop of the war effort (WW I). The contemporary story is set in 1933 and Slade looks like he has aged forty years instead of only 16 or so. He looks MUCH older than his contemporaries. However, maybe they intended to achieve this effect to accentuate his gnarliness. I just thought it was too much. The only other thing is that many of the actors are obviously Canadian born (Mr. and Mrs. Thatcher and Helen , for example)and several times their Canadian tones and speech patterns come out.

This particular version, starring Henry Winkler as Benedict Slade (a.k.a. Scrooge) is my favorite.\nThe movie translates Dickens' classic story from 19th century England to Depression-era New England.  The result is very effective.  For me, an American born to parents who grew up in the Depression, the 20th century setting made the story feel very real.  The writers and director made excellent decisions in their choice of sets.  Three notable examples were the New England furniture factory as the setting for Slade's youth, the newly-conceived idea of consumer credit as the source of his subsequent wealth and avarice, and the choice of an African-American as the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come (\"You must be Future,\" Slade declares, cowering before him).\nWinkler's performance is brilliant.  He captures the essence of Slade perfectly, and makes the gradual transformation from miser to redeemed man seem natural and believable.  The scene at the Thatcher (a.k.a. Cratchit) household at the end of the film never fails to bring tears to my eyes and those of my family.  The supporting cast performs ably as well, making this a Christmas classic that one can watch every year.\n\"An American Christmas Carol\" debuted in 1979, midway through Winkler's popular \"Happy Days\" television series run.  After a few years of reruns, it disappeared from view until recently, when it became available on DVD and video.  I heartily recommend it for your holiday DVD collection.", "summary": "My Favorite \"Christmas Carol\"", "unixReviewTime": 1040601600}, {"overall": 5.0, "vote": "11", "verified": false, "reviewTime": "11 9, 2002", "reviewerID": "A1A9WDWEVC5AC0", "asin": "0005019281", "style": {"Format:": " VHS Tape"}, "reviewerName": "christopher", "reviewText": "First time i saw this movie was 1985 on television.
